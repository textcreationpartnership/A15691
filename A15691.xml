            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This pamphlet he intituled,</hi> A few plaine and forcible Reaſons for the Catholike Faith, againſt the Religion of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. <hi>Theſe reaſons comming into the hands of a young Papiſt and Recuſant, as I take it, whom this or ſome other deceitfull workeman had poyſoned with the venome of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie: He attributed ſo much thereunto, that being moued by a faithfull and louing kinſeman to renounce his popiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſancie and to come to the Church and become a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, he anſwered that he was vndoubte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This Pamphlet being thus come to his hands, God offering opportunitie of a Chriſtian meeting of ſome few of vs Fellow-miniſters, he brought forth vnto vs, and ſpecially requeſted me (the Pamphlet being not very long) a little that time to peruſe it, which in ſome part I did. Being further moued by him to take it in hand, and to frame and anſwer thereunto. I alleaged for a tuſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, that there was in it nothing new, but that which had beene often obiected and often anſwered: And therefore as this</hi> Crambe <hi>I held not worth the anſwering, ſo if any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolued were deſirous to receiue ſatisfaction in the matter, they might plentefully find it, if they liſted to peruſe what before time had bene anſwered by many others. Howbeit not ſo ſatisfying him, for that it ſeemed good (theſe 4 Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being ſo highly eſteemed) to diſcouer the vanity of them, I was content to take them with me, as he requeſted; Yet without any certaine promiſe to deale with them, the rather becauſe I had then in hand ſome labor of writing in another argument, which being finiſhed, finding by peruſing them, how full of vaine oſtentation they were how ſubtle by a new fiction to pretend ſomewhat for Poperie out of the Religion of Proteſtants, how pernicious by ſtriuing to worke the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est reſolution in Papiſts, how cloſely the matter was conueted to get authoritie and credit to popiſh hereſie by theſe Corner creeping reaſons, which ſeemed already to be made familiar to the vulgar ſort. I thought it a point of charitie plainly and demonſtratiuely ſo to lay open the vanity of them, as euen the vulgar ſort, whoſe iudgement was already captiuated, by theſe reaſons, might be able to diſcerne the truth of my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.

But would you haue two congregations, or two only perſons for euery hundreth yeare? Before the captiuitie of Gods Church vnder Popiſh tyrannie, let the godly Martyrs, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and Paſtors, whom hiſtories do record, and whoſe writings are extant, teſtifie the faith of thoſe congregations wherein they liued and ſerued in the chiefeſt points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which we maintaine againſt Papiſts. That famous Iewell of bleſſed memorie hath to your euerlaſting ſhame maintained it, and if the God of this world had not blinded <note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 3. 4.</note> your eyes, that the light of the glorious Goſpell of Chriſt ſhould not ſhine vnto you; Nay if the iuſt God had not <note place="margin">2.

After the Popes had once fully got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into the chaire of Apoſtaſie, the aſhes of thoſe witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, whom for the teſtimonie of Ieſus Chriſt you haue ſlaine, as they are kept in ſtore for a witneſſe againſt you on earth, ſo their ſpirits now in heauen do cry againſt you as the bloud of <hi>Abel</hi> againſt <hi>Cain.</hi> Since the diſcouery of that Man of ſinne in theſe latter yeares, you haue found our congregations through Gods goodneſſe much thicker in all nations then you would haue ſuffered, if your <hi>Nimrods</hi> armes had bene as long as they are wont to be.</p>
                  <p>But what if we ſhould onely anſwer you, that the firſt of theſe 1600. is more in triall of truth then all the reſt, as that one day of the inſtitution of Matrimonie betweene one man <note place="margin">Math. 19. 4.</note> and one woman ioyned together by an vnſeparable knot, is more to proue the integritie thereof, then all the yeares

Would you renounce the triall of theſe incorrupted times, and appeale to the latter, wherein ſundry corruptions were apparantly crept in? What were this elſe but to ſhunne the light, as the maner of deceiuers and euill doers is? What the religion of this hundreth was, nay what it ought to be for euer, let the Apoſtolike writers witneſſe, and it the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Proteſtant congregations be the ſame with the religion taught, beleeued and practiſed in that hundreth, let all the latter times know, that they are too young to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trole it, much more let Popiſh noueltie retire into the ſchooles and cloyſters where it was bred.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, all the times ſucceeding haue imbraced the Scriptures as the very word of God, haue retained the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith called the Apoſtles Creede, as agreeable to holy Scriptures, and only herein haue ſought for the Canon and rule of truth.

What ſopln ſtrie is this, becauſe at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times of the yeare they were free to chuſe at what time beſides the three named they would communicate, ſo they did all communicate then, therefore the communion was in old time free, as if the Church required no man at any time to receiue the communion? Thus wily you are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile your ſelfe, and thoſe that will be led by you. Chriſt left it not free for Chriſtians to communicate or not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, neither did the Church of old time ſo obſerue it. Chriſt left it free for men to confeſſe in the eare of a Prieſt, or not to confeſſe, and the Church of old time ſo obſerued it.

And by the way, all men may ſee what peace of conſcience Popery breeds, that leaues men vnder the torture of an accuſing conſcience for all the ſinnes they can remember, and that euen in the howre of death. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul, 1.

It is therefore vntrue and ſheweth want of faith that you ſay, <hi>you thinke all the ſinnes that come to minde ſhould trouble a Chriſtian mans conſcience.</hi> And yet it agreeth well with your Popiſh ſpirit, which is the <hi>Spirit of bondage, and not of adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of feare, and not of promiſe.</hi> We ſay indeed that death is the <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15. &amp; 6, 23.</note> wages of all ſin, and therefore all ſinne is mortall and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, but we ſay that <hi>no ſinne ſhall be laide to the charge of Gods</hi>

                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:5087:24"/> giues as much authority to euery brother, as to a Prieſt to heare confeſsions: For of confeſſion in the eare of a Prieſt, you can ſhew no tittle in the ſcripture. Howbeit as by the aduiſe and counſell of holy Scripture, Chriſtians are taught to eaſe their oppreſſed conſciences into the boſoms of their faithfull brethren, to the end they may be partakers of their comfort and prayers, ſo we thinke it alſo a godly courſe and a ready meane to find comfort, if the ſheepe of the flocke do open their woundes to their paſtor, who hath wiſdome and faithfulnes to powre in wine and oile, that is, to miniſter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the word of admonition and conſolation; and this is the meaning of our Communion booke, but what is this to Popiſh Eare ſhrift?</p>
                  <p>Yea, but the booke preſcribeth alſo <hi>how after confeſsion the Prieſt must abſolue him, and the maner of words.</hi> You ſhoulde haue dealt faithfully, if you had ſet downe the whole truth. Our booke appointeth the Prieſt firſt to pray vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that he would grant vnto the ſicke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon truely repenting and beleeuing in him, forgiuenes of all his ſinnes, as acknowledging it to be the onely right of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt to forgiue ſins. Secondly, preſuppoſing the ſicke man truely to repent and to beleeue in Chriſt, it appointeth the Prieſt by the authority of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who hath left power to his Church to abſolue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant ſinners (which power is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> executed by the Prieſt) to abſolue the ſicke from all ſinnes. To abſolue, I ſay, not to forgiue: For Chriſt onely forgiueth, as our booke there vnderſtandeth forgiueneſſe, and as it is vnderſtood in the Lords prayer, and as it is vnderſtood in the Lords prayer, and is interpreted by the Prophet <hi>Dauid, Pſalme, 32. 1. 2.

But as for reuiuing any other vſe of it after ſo long diſuſe, our Church thought, it might rather tend to ſuperſtition, then to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the rather becauſe your Popiſh confidence in ſuch bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily exerciſes had greatly corrupted the primitiue ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of the vulgar vſe thereof among the firſt Chriſtians. There is no word of God that willeth the vſe of it, nor anie word of God, that I know, that forbiddeth the bare vſe of it. It grew out of a deſire the faithfull had to teſtifie before the enemies of Chriſt, their faith in Chriſt crucified. In the vſe thereof it ſeemeth they felt further comfort, not hauing confidence in the ſigne, but in Chriſt whom they confeſſed by that ſigne.

A tranſient ſigne to ſignifie in geſture, that which the word ſignifieth in ſpeech, and that onely for meanes of confeſſion, differeth much from an image made to repreſent the Sonne of God, whoſe Godhead no colours, nor proportion can expreſſe, whoſe Manhood is not the whole of his perſon, whoſe nature, perſon and ſuffering is ſufficiently, yea abundantly deſcribed in the Scriptures for all men to ſee and heare,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:5087:26"/> neither is it poſſible for any art to make that viſible in the image of the crucifixe, which is to be knowne, beleeued &amp; remembred of Chriſt and his ſufferings, according to the deſcription of his word. To leaue the Scriptures &amp; follow a crucifixe, is to go from the Sunne in the firmament, to the ſigne of the ſunne painted in a table: To adde to the word the helpe of the crucifix, is to accuſe the infufficiencie of the word. The ſigne of the Croſſe had no ſuch vſe in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, neither hath now with vs, and therefore differeth largely from the ſigne of the crucifixe: But it is worth the marking, how barely you bring into compariſon, firſt the vſe of the ſigne of the Croſſe among vs, and the vſe thereof in poperie. Do we teach to truſt in that ſigne? Do we pray to it? do we worſhip it? do we bleſſe with it? do we fence &amp; arme our ſelues with it? theſe are your Idolatries which you ſlily paſſe ouer, as if there were a like vſe of the ſigne of the Croſſe with vs and with you Papiſts. Secondly, the ſigne of the Croſſe, and the image of the crucifixe, as if you did only make the image of the crucifixe hiſtorically and not to worſhip it. When we commit idolatrie with the ſigne of the Croſſe, then compare our vſe thereof, with your idolatries to the image of the cruciſixe. Laſtly, remember heere alſo that which I ſpake of the former; The ſigne of the Croſſe is only an indifferent externall rite among vs, It is neither principle, nor ſecond, nor third, nor fourth, nor any point of our Religion.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, we haue ſhewed you before that by the iudgement of <hi>Cardinall Caietane,</hi> whom <hi>Andradius</hi> defends in it, it is lawfull, yea and neceſſarie ſometimes in interpretation of Scriptures, to leaue the ſtreame of the Fathers, and follow a diuerſe interpretation from them all, which might at no hand be admitted, if (as you preſume) wherein they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conſent, they had beene all guided by the ſpirit of truth. <hi>Andradius</hi> doth not onely ſay ſo, but giues good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it: <hi>The literall ſenſe of Scripture</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth onelie yeeld arguments to confirme points of religion: But the Fathers in infinite ſtaies of the old teſtament, chieflie do leaue the literall ſenſe and follow the tropologicall or allegoricall ſenſe.</hi> In deciding of Doctrines, then which is to be done by the litterall ſenſe, what helpe ſhall we haue from the conſent of <hi>Fathers,</hi> who very ſeldome giue the litterall ſenſe?

                     <hi>among themſelues, alwaies ſauing whole the frame of faith, and in ſome one matter, ſome ſay better and more trulie then others. But this about which we now deale, belongeth to the very foundations of faith,</hi> ſpeaking of originall ſinne in children.

This is all which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did, or requires others to doe, Neither do <hi>Auguſtines</hi> words by you alleadged ſerue your turne. For what if the Fathers did conſtantly hold the Doctrine of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne ſpread ouer all men, and hauing receiued it from their Fathers, ſo deliuered it to their poſteritie, Doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> beleeued it either onely or principally, becauſe they did conſtantly teach it? You heard the contrary out of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> before that that point is clearely and fully to be prooued by the Canonical Scriptures, which euen his owne words in this very place doe teſtifie, <hi>They all found it before any of them deliuered it?</hi> Where did they finde it, but in the Scriptures? The conſent of <hi>Fathers</hi> may helpe to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Scriptures, but it is no rule to vnderſtand them by, but rather the Scriptures are the rule to iudge of thoſe truthes wherein the Fathers do conſent.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Paul</hi> indeed ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt gaue vnto his Church paſtors and teachers, that we ſhould not be caried about with eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vvind of doctrine,</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith not that Paſtors and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors may cary vs about with what doctrines they liſt, or that we haue no libertie to trie their doctrine, whether it be of God or no. God the Father ſaith of his Son Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>This is my well-beloued ſonne, heare him.</hi> Yet our Sauior Chriſt commandeth his Church to ſearch the Scriptures. <hi>Paul was called to be an Apostle</hi> not by man, but <hi>by Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> yet did the men of <hi>Beraea</hi> trie his doctrine by the Scriptures, and are therefore commended by the holy Ghoſt.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Propoſition of this ſecond ſyllogiſme ſtanding in greateſt neede of proofe, you leaue it altogether vnproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and ſo after your maner, you begge that alwaies which is in queſtion: For in the words of Scripture by you abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, you ſhould haue prooued, Firſt, that the word, <hi>Heare,</hi> is to be extended to all matters generally; Secondly, that by <hi>(the Church)</hi> are meant onely generall Councels. Thirdly, that the Church is to be heard howſoeuer it iudge, which points except you prooue, the conſequence inferred in the Propoſition will not follow.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, the matter heere referred to the Church, is not <hi>deciſion of doctrines, but cenſure of ſcandals,</hi> as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> vpon the place obſerueth. Now will it follow, <hi>He that obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Churches cenſure in matter of ſcandall giuen to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is to be taken as an heathen or publican. Therefore Councels may not be diſobeyed, whatſoeuer they teach in matter of faith and doctrine?</hi> Secondly, muſt we expect a generall Councel for redreſſe of euery ſcandall committed againſt a brother, by him that will not be brought to amendment by more priuate admonition? Did not the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> cenſure the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:5087:37"/> ſcandall of the inceſtuous perſon? Had not the Church of <note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 2. Theſ 3. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> power to cenſure the inordinate walkers? And hath not euery particular Church power to cenſure all ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals within themſelues? By your reaſon then wee may not diſobey particular Churches in their deriſions of Doctrine, neither can they erre any more then generall Councels, which your ſelues will not yeeld, and the errours of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> doe gaine ſay. To ſhew the inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of your proofe, I will ſet by it this argument.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee that will not heare a particular Church cenſuring in matter of ſcandall, is to be helde as an heathen or publican.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore wee may not diſobey a particular Church in matter of doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt part you cannot denie, the conſequent I knowe you will not yeeld: ſuch is the force of your forcible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, doth not the place expreſly limit the cenſure of the Church, whereunto obedience muſt be giuen. Firſt, it is ſuppoſed in the text, that a brother hath treſpaſſed againſt a brother. Secondly, that it cannot be denied but he hath done ſo. Thirdly, that his fault is tolde him as alone, and with two or three witneſſes, ſo by the Church. Laſtly, that the party offending conuict of the offence, and iuſtly cenſured by the Church, obeyeth not. But if either the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had not treſpaſſed, or had not beene conuicted, and ſo the Church had vniuſtly cenſured him, or if the Church had corruptly impoſed any thing vpon him, either to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or to be done: was he then not hearing to be taken as a publican or an heathen? Our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith not ſo. For this had beene to giue tyrannicall power ouer mens ſoules and conſciences into the hands of the Church, which our Sauiour neuer did. Now if wee ſhould graunt you that hearing of the Church in this place, might be extended to matter of Doctrine, if by like proportion you ſuppoſe, that the determination of the Church is agreeable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that the Church by the Scriptures approoueth their determination to the conſciences of the faithfull, as we then graunt you that we may not diſobey ſo this will helpe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:5087:37"/> your cauſe nothing at all, who will not ſubmit the ſentence of generall Councels to be tried by the Scriptures, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it ſuperior to the Scriptures, and conſequently Lord ouer mens conſciences. which as the Apoſtle ſcrbiddeth to <note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 1.</note> the elders of the Church in all ſeuerall Churches, ſo doth he alſo to the elders aſſembled in agenerall Councell.

                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, you conclude not the queſtion. Which is not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church may erre, but whether generall <hi>Councels may erre.</hi> But neither are generall <hi>Councels</hi> ſo large as the onely viſible Church, being but ſpeciall members aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled out of the whole, whoſe errour may not be imputed, no not to the whole viſible Church, neither is the viſible Church the whole Church, no not the whole militant Church; and therefore although the gates of hell cannot preuaile againſt the Church, yet they may preuaile againſt generall Councels.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Church may erre, and yet hell gates not preuaile againſt it. For the Propoſition of the former ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme containing your reaſon, is not true. The gates of hell doe not preuaile againſt euery one that erreth. <hi>Peter</hi> erred both in matter of fact, and in matter of faith. His errors in matter of fact are knowen to be many, and not denied by you. His error in matter of faith, was in iudging it vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to eate of things common: yet did not the gates of hell <note place="margin">Act. 10, 14.</note> preuaile againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the gates of hell not preuailing againſt the whole militant Church, may yet preuaile againſt the viſible parts of this Church, and in ſome age or ages; It followeth
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:5087:38"/> not therefore, that if the gates of hell preuaile againſt the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Churches of ſome age that therefore they doe preuaile againſt the whole militant Church. Where be the famous Churches of <hi>Achain,</hi> of <hi>Galatia,</hi> of <hi>Macedonia?</hi> nay, what a handfull is the remnant of the Church now in a corner of <hi>Europe,</hi> principally knowen by the name of the Church, to the large circuit of the Church, both in the Apoſtles time, and after ſpread ouer the whole world? Will you ſay, the gates of hell haue preuailed againſt the Church, becauſe they haue preuailed againſt ſome Churches, ſo many, ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in ſome age or ages. The Church of Chriſt may be more and leſſe occumenicall, and yet the Church of Chriſt ſtill, againſt which the gates of hell, neither haue, nor euer ſhall preuaile: and yet may preuaile againſt the Churches of <hi>Achaia, Galatia, Macedonia,</hi> and many others: yea, againſt the once famous Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as they haue done, ſo that the faithfull citie may become an <hi>harlot.</hi> Wherefore begin <note place="margin">Iſa. 1. 21.</note> once to be aſhamed of this ſophiſtrie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The gates of hell cannot prenaile againſt the Church of Chriſt.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Therfore not againſt a generall Councell,</hi> which is but ſome of the many churches of one time, and is far from the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the whole church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Your third reaſon is <hi>Then were it not alſo the pillar and ground of truth, as S.</hi> Paul <hi>affirmeth.</hi> Let vs alſo bring this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into forme.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, what is this to generall <hi>Councels,</hi> which are not that church which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the <hi>pillar and ground of truth,</hi> but at the beſt onely ſome part of it? that church is the houſe of the liuing God, which extends it ſelfe more largely both in regard of perſons and times, then to the number aſſembled in ſome generall councels, in ſome times of the church. Whereby it commeth to paſſe, that (as before hath beene noted out of <hi>Auguſtine)</hi> generall councels haue corrected prouinciall, and the later generall <hi>councels</hi> haue corrected
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:5087:38"/> the former. Wherefore ſome generall councell or councels may erre, and yet the church remain ſtill the <hi>pillar and ground of truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Church is called the <hi>pillar and ground of truth,</hi> (as hath bene ſhewed) becauſe the Oracles of God are committed vnto it, which the church keepeth faithfully to the worlds end. By which as by an vndoubted marke the true Church is knowne from the falſe: For the falſe church caſteth away and corrupteth the Scriptures, neither doth vphold and beare vp the truth by the preaching of the Goſpell, as is manifeſtly ſeene in the Apoſtaticall church of Rome. Contrariwiſe the true church conſerueth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of Gods truth, and preacheth the doctrine of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, for the gathering of the Saints, and the edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 12. Mal. 2. 7.</note> of it ſelfe. Howbeit as the Prieſt whoſe lips ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue knowledge, and at whoſe mouth they ſhould inquire the law, may ſometimes faile in the knowledge and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the law: So the viſible church may in ſome points of truth hold erroneous opinions, and yet continue ſtill the <hi>pillar and ground of truth,</hi> to wit, of that truth which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to ſaluation, in the true knowledge and cuſtodie whereof the true Church ſhall neuer deceiue nor be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. The Apoſtles and Diſciples of our Sauiour Chriſt at the time of his aſcention, were the onely true viſible church of Chriſt, who vndoubtedly were <hi>the pillar and ground of</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, as before hath bene ſhewed out of <hi>Chryſoſtome, The truth is the pillar and firmament of the Church.</hi> For as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>

                     </hi> noteth out of <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> So the Church layeth the foundation of truth, and beareth vp the truth by confeſſing and preaching. <hi>Inqua ſolu</hi> (as <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> noteth) <hi>nunc veritas ſtat firmata, &amp; que ſolatotum edificium ſuſtinet veritatis,</hi> that is, <hi>In vvhich alone the truth novv ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth grounded, and which alone beareth vp the vvhole building of truth.</hi> Not that the church is as Ladie ouer the truth, but as an handmaide to the truth.

                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe you ſay it is a malitious corruption againſt the deſcending of Chriſt into hell, what if it were tranſlated, thou wilt not leaue my ſoule in hell, would it prooue that <hi>Chriſtes</hi> ſoule was in hell? nothing leſſe. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> vpon that place of the Pſalme, <hi>Quoniam non derelin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques animam meam in inferno,</hi> maketh this gloſſe, <hi>Becauſe thou wilt neither giue my ſoule to be poſſeſſed of hell,</hi> and vpon the next words, <hi>Neque dabis Sanctum tuum videre corruptionem, neque ſanctificarum corpus per quod &amp; alij ſanctificandi ſunt, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumpi patieris.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:5087:47"/> that God left not his ſoule in hell, becauſe he neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered his ſoule to hell and ſo he neuer came there in ſoule.

So Chriſt taking our ſinnes vpon him whereunto hell fire was due, and conflicting with the wrath of God, being ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his Father, that hee ſhould not be deliuered euer into the power of hell, confidently reioyceth in God ſaying, <hi>I haue ſet the Lord alwaies before me, he is at my right hand, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall not be mooued, wherefore my heart is glad, my tongue reioyceth, my fleſh alſo ſhall reſt in hope, For thou wilt not leaue my ſoule in hell</hi> (if you will needes ſo tranſlate) <hi>neither wilt thou ſuffer thine holie one to ſee corruption,</hi> not meaning that he had beene in hell, or was to be in hell, but giuing thanks to God who heard his prayer, and preſerued him from hell, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb. 5. 7.

                  <p>Laſtly, vpon the 85.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:5087:47"/> when he died: to the which hell, ſaith <hi>Auguſtine, Chriſt came that we might no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If Chriſt went into no other hell then the faithfull goe, hee neuer went into hell of the damned, where the faithfull neuer come. And therefore to conclude, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> though he tranſlate <hi>in inferno</hi> and <hi>ex inferno,</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth onely the graue, or at the largeſt, the Region of death whither the dead goe.

                  <p>But beſides for anſwere to your accuſations, if you pleaſe to compare that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1. <hi>Tim. 3. 16.

                  <p>The third corruption wherewith you charge our tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, <hi>Are in priſon,</hi> for <hi>were in priſon.</hi> If you vnderſtand <hi>Priſon</hi> as <hi>Augustine</hi> doth, though you reade <hi>Were in priſon,</hi> what get you by it? if by priſon the place of vnbeleeuers and diſobedient perſons after this life be meant, as the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their ſinne, and of their puniſhment ſo coupled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether doe import, what is that but hell, wherein they were not when <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Spirit, or By his Spirit preached vnto them, but now are, and therefore vnderſtanding Chriſt to haue preached to them in <hi>Noes</hi> time (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth) you cannot ſay they were then in priſon when Chriſt preached, but rather are now for their diſobedience.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it might be heer noted, how you are faine to fetch about to fit this place to your <hi>Limbus.</hi> For whereas <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of thoſe that were in <hi>Noes</hi> time diſobedient, and

                  <p>Firſt, what neede we ſtraine any Scripture to prooue this point, when the Apoſtle in plaine words ſaith, that <hi>a Biſhop</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>muſt be the husband of one wife?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, your tranſlation rather ſtraineth and miſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the words, putting that firſt which is ſecond. For in the Apoſtles words <hi>Siſter</hi> is in the firſt place, in your tranſlation you haue put it in the ſecond place, to make as if it were a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of the generall word <hi>Woman</hi> onely to <hi>Siſters,</hi> that is beleeuing women. Whereas indeede the Apoſtle hauing firſt ſaide a ſiſter neede not add a <hi>Woman,</hi> which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily implied in the name <hi>Siſter,</hi> and therefore addeth the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:5087:50"/> meant a <hi>Siſter</hi> being a wife, the fitteſt companion of their iourneies.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it agreeth neither with the Apoſtles words, nor his purpoſe to interpret his words as you vſe to doe of ſuch like women as followed our Sauiour Chriſt, and miniſtred vnto him and his, of their ſubſtance: For what power or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie <note place="margin">Luk. 8. 3.</note> had the Apoſtles to leade about ſuch women after them? but to leade about a wife they had power. Beſides, the purpoſe of the Apoſtle is to ſhew that himſelfe and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> had right to put the Church to more charge by lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a one about with them: but if he had meant ſuch women as following them in their iourneies, miniſtred vnto them of their ſubſtance, to haue ſuch in their company, had beene an eaſe and no charge to the Church, the contrarie whereof the Apoſtle plainely expreſſeth, in giuing reaſon why he and <hi>Barnabas</hi> might haue done ſo, <hi>Who goeth a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare at any time of his owne coſt? &amp;c.

                  <p>Laſtly, you knowe that the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Mariage is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable amongst all men, and the bed vndefiled.</hi> What more <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 4.</note> cleare and full allowance can there be, that Prieſts may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully marie, except you will ſay, that prieſthood depriueth them of the honour of Gods ordinance, which he hath ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified to all men.

                     </q> Hitherto <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> hath ſet forth the faire and deceiueable ſhewes that falſe Prophets make both of their works and of their faith. wherein they would ſeeme to be ſheepe, but are indeed rauening Woolues.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:5087:60"/> but if it be not as Christ hath commaunded, he is a falſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.

                  <p>Briefly to make Application. The Popiſh Church is of great authoritie, euen for the very names ſake of the Church with all ſeduced Papiſts. Their oſtentation of almes, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and faſting, makes a great ſhew in their eies Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt, their altars, their pretended ſacrifice, their baptiſme, their reading of Scriptures, and ſhew of Fathers, their prieſtly order do ſeeme to be infallible ſignes of a true Church. Howbeit, as you haue ſeene, <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> affirmeth that heretikes haue all theſe, yet are they no more the true Church for theſe then an Ape is a man, for the reſemblance he hath of the parts of mans body.

What then is to be done to diſcerne them? Try them by their fruits, that is the confeſſion of their faith, and the workes of their conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And how ſhall we trie the confeſſion of their faith? by the Scriptures (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome)</hi> and by the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt. But Papiſts admit no triall of their faith, but by themſelues they are the Church. The Pope is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Paſtor: he that will not heare this Church and this Paſtor, is held <hi>Anathema as an heathen or Publican.</hi> What is this elſe but that which <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaieth, <hi>they ruling the Church, doe openlie and licentiouſlie ſubuert the Church:</hi> for they preſcribe their owne practiſe for the rule of faith, and take away all indifferent meanes of triall, and will be both ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers and iudges of faith.

They make Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of thoſe, who for barbarous treaſons, rebellions, and murthers, haue iuſtly ſuffered ſuch puniſhment as they deſerued both by the law of God and man. Are theſe the works of ſheepe or of woolues? <hi>By their fruites therefore you ſhall knowe them:</hi> they are on euery ſide full of ſharpe and cruell prickles.

If they do any thing well, they doe it for vaine glory to beſeene of men, and to get a name to themſelues. Is this the Church whereof euery man muſt be a member, or elſe he cannot be ſaued? is this the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith?</hi> is this to liue according to the faith? will any man be ſo blinded, that for loue or zeale to ſuch a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, or for awe or feare of the curſe of ſuch curſed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, he will refuſe to ioyne with the Proteſtants in their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice &amp; Sacraments? My deare brethren, put no truſt in any childe of man, which by <hi>Auguſtines</hi> confeſſion our Sauiour Chriſt forbiddeth, Pin not your ſaluation vpon his ſleeue, that may go to hell himſelfe, I meane the Pope. Beware of them that outwardly weare onely ſheepes clothing, but inwardly are very rauening Woolues, as you finde by their fruits. Truſt not them that will be tried for their truth and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:5087:62"/> honeſtie by none but themſelues, ſuſpect their honeſtie that ſhut vp the Scriptures from you, which our Sauiour Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded all men to ſearch. Finally, inquire whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> or any Apoſtle, or any holy Councel or Father did euer put poyſon, ſword, or powder into mens hands, to murther the ſacred perſons of Kings, to ruinate whole Kingdomes, and to promote the faith of Chriſt by poyſon, ſword, and fire. If you finde any ſuch preſident, hearken to this forcible reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and all other Ieſuites and Seminaries, refuſe our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, our ſeruice, and Sacraments. If not, diſclaime that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that faith, that ſeruice, that Sacrament that ſerueth to combine ſuch conſpiracies, that muſt get vp and proſper by ſuch monſtrous and endleſſe crueltie. God of his mercie open your eyes, that the light of the glorious Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus may ſhine vnto you, that you may be able to diſcerne the myſterie of iniquitie, which of long time hath wrought in the Kingdome of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> that you may knowe the ſynagogue of Satan, from the Church of Chriſt, and at length come out from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and eſcape the wrath preſent and to come, and finally be ſaued by the only faith of Ieſus Chriſt, to whom be glory for euer. <hi>Amen.</hi>
